# Hi there! I'm Daniel.
I'm a web developer from austria. I love building small or large scale applications for the browser. I develop not only to earn a living I also do it in my spare time.
Apart from developing I like to go out and search for Geocaches. It's fascinating to see a lot of different places I never would have found otherwise.

Lately the idea came to my mind to combine both of my favorite hobbies and share them with the folks out there.
