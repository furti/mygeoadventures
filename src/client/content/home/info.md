# Additional information
If your first thought was "But i don't know anything about programming!! ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±", dont't be afraid.
1. There is a good description for every project.
2. Most of the time the "programming" consists of copying already available code.
3. And if you really really don't want to learn something by implementing the missing code parts, they will be available online for you ðŸ™ˆ.

Because most of the projects are built with web technologies you don't need to install any additional software. Assumed you have a browser installed already. But without you wouldn't be here ðŸ˜….
