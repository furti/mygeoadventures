# What is a project?
Basically a project is a application you can run and enjoy. Each project consists of an basic framework you can download from this page and some missing parts you have to search for.

There are different kinds of frameworks. You can find informations about the right framework on the projects detail page. A framework will fit for multiple projects. To save some bandwith you may download the project once and duplicate (copy and paste) the donwloaded folder for each project you are working on.

The missing files are hidden in geocaches out there. The geocaches needed for a project are listed on the projects detail page. Sometimes a file is divided into multiple parts. So you have to find all of them and put them together to get the final file.

Most of the files are complete when you find them. But for some files some implementation details are missing. You have to implement them on you own to get a functional application. Don't worry, if you can't figure out the right implementation there is a solution available for you on the projects detail page.
