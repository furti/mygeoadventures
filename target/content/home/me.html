<h1 id="hi-there-i-m-daniel-">Hi there! I&#39;m Daniel.</h1>
<p>I&#39;m a web developer from austria. I love building small or large scale applications for the browser. I develop not only to earn a living i also do it in my spare time.
Apart from developing i like to go out and search for Geocaches. It&#39;s fascinating to see a lot of different places I never would have found otherwise.</p>
<p>Lately the idea came to my mind to combine both of my favorite hobbies and share them with the folks out there.</p>
