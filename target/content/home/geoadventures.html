<h1 id="my-geo-adventures-what-is-that-">My Geo Adventures, What is that?</h1>
<p>As i love coding there are a bunch of small projects on my harddrive right now. And there will be even more in the future. I thought some others might be interesed in this projects too. So i decided to share them with you... and you... and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUHrYgq3U6E"target="_blank">double you</a>.</p>
<p>I will print out some important parts of each project on good old sheets of paper. So there is no simple copy and paste. You will have to transfer the code to your computer by yourself (Assumed that you don&#39;t have some form of character recognition. But that would be some kind of cheating ðŸ˜œ). Then i put this sheet in a geocache out there. Now it&#39;s your turn to go out and find the cache that contains the code, take a picture of it and complete the project for yourself.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="projects">projects</a> section for more details on where to find the caches and what to do with the code snippets.</p>
<p>Some of the projects can be found on my github account. But be honest to yourself and don&#39;t spoiler yourself. It will destroy all the exitement ðŸ˜‰.</p>
